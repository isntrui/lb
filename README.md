## ‚öôÔ∏è API Implementation

### Built with Spring Framework

LB Tool leverages the power of the Spring ecosystem to deliver a robust API. The following components are utilized in the development:

1. **Spring Core:**
   - The foundational framework that provides the core functionality of dependency injection and aspect-oriented programming.
   - Enables loose coupling through Inversion of Control (IoC), making the application easier to manage and test.

2. **Spring Boot:**
   - Simplifies the setup and development of new applications by providing defaults for configuration.
   - Allows rapid development with minimal boilerplate code, enabling developers to focus on business logic rather than infrastructure.

3. **Spring Web:**
   - Facilitates the creation of RESTful APIs using simple annotations such as `@RestController`, `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc.
   - Supports JSON as the default data exchange format, ensuring seamless communication between client and server.

4. **Spring Data JPA:**
   - Provides an abstraction layer over JPA (Java Persistence API) to simplify database interactions.
   - Enables easy CRUD operations through repository interfaces without needing extensive boilerplate code.
